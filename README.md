# cruiser
A Perl script for very lightweight web publishing

##What cruiser is
Cruiser is a tool for very rapidly organizing information in a web-accessible directory.  It is a server-side script that is essentially an enhanced directory lister.  It uses an auxilliary file to annotate and organize the contents of the current directory.

Cruiser supports lightweight web publishing, because the moment a file becomes part of the server's document tree it is published.  Annotations and other embellishments can be added later to make the files easier to navigate.

##What cruiser is not
Cruiser is not a full-featured web page editor.  Other tools should be used for that purpose.

##License
The license for Cruiser is the Apache 2.0 License
